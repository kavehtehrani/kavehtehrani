I work as a quantitative portfolio manager focused mostly on digital assets while living full time as a digital nomad.

I am a recovering tradfi banker. I worked in traditional finance for +10 years as an investment banker, derivatives trader, and quantitative portfolio manager before leaving for entrepreneurial pursuits.

I grew up with computers and fell in love with programming in my teenage years.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity and front-end JS frameworks, mainly React and Next.js
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything web3 related!

My personal website is at [kaveh.page](kaveh.page).
