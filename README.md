### Hi, I'm [Kaveh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveh_the_Blacksmith)! 👋

I work as a quantitative portfolio manager focused mostly on digital assets while living sometimes as a digital nomad.

I am a recovering tradfi banker. I worked in traditional finance for +10 years as an investment banker, derivatives trader, and quantitative portfolio manager before leaving for entrepreneurial pursuits.

I grew up with computers and fell in love with programming in my teenage years. I absolutely love software development, especially the collaborative open-source kind.

🌱 I’m currently working with Solidity, Rust, and front-end JS frameworks, mainly React and Next.js\
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything web3 related!

My personal website is at [kaveh.page](https://kaveh.page).
